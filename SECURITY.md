# Security Policy
PLEASE READ THIS 
hey auyongtingting, amber here. Just wanna apologise to you for chatting up with Caleb, 
I didnt know he was attached and thereafter, I was told that you guys ended things. 
But whichever the case, I've always encourage him to give your relationship another go, and i'm happy that you all did. But definitely, I should have known better to 
not randomly chat up with a person out for fun or whichever the case is being made to me by caleb, but just want to assure you i'm not interested in taking your man 
or whatever ya. and i honestly think you're a nice girl, so wishing you all well! i really hope you see this though, cause i dont have linkedin premium to speak to you 
about it but yes, you go ugurl~ 

and i'm sorry for cancelling the online movie watching thingy, i didnt know you were his gf at that point, and if i did, i wouldnt have just cut it off like this. Regardless or whatever, 
i didnt know how to reach out to you but now i do. okay that's all i've got, goodbye~
